      <h2>Target Passengers</h2>
      <p>
        Another element defined early in the design process is the primary group(s) the service is intended to serve effectively. The inefficiencies perceived by stakeholders may either affect the general public or a specific segment of the population. In the former case, the system should be designed to serve society as a whole, maximizing the number of passengers who can benefit from the service. 
        In the latter, the system is focused on addressing the needs of a particular group, and certain features must be tailored to meet the specific requirements of that group. Based on our review, we identified three main types of target passengers, as listed below:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><u>General Passengers:</u> The entire population is considered as potential users of the system. There are no design concessions favoring a particular group.</li>
        
        <li><u>Population in Need (low-income, impaired, elderly):</u> This group typically includes individuals with physical disabilities, low-income populations, and the elderly—many of whom often lack access to other forms of transportation. The most common trip purposes for this demographic are medical appointments, shopping, and leisure activities. Comfort-related features—such as door-to-door and direct services—are generally valued more highly than strict punctuality.</li>
        
        <li><u>Time-Sensitive Passengers (youth in school age or working population):</u> Generally composed of younger individuals and those who are economically active, this group uses transport primarily for school and work-related activities. Since these activities are highly time-dependent, punctuality tends to be prioritized over comfort.</li>
      </ul>
